    "description": "This is my implementation of an OCR using Resnet. Resnet is one of the best Neural Network architectures for image classification and it's biggest advantage is the fact that as the network depth increases, it cancels negative outcomes. I have used the MNIST dataset for numbers and A_Z dataset from Kaggle for the letters.Accuracy is around 96%."
